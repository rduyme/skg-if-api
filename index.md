# API Specifications

{: .highlight }
**Work in progress**: The WG agreed with RDA a 6-month deadline extension (i.e., end of June 2025) in order to deliver full-fledged API specifications that go beyond the "vanilla" resolvers here described. We opted for **OpenAPI** to describe the endpoints and the format of the objects to exchange on the wire. The YAML file will be soon shared here. Stay tuned! In the meantime, you can have a preview of the ongoing work [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t7b7h28UTtM56Sda4NGJIp0hnQfGbcVVGn12fny9wfI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.hso3muyqtlhx).
